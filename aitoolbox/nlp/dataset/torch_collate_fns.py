    TODO: Write the actual docstring


    Creates mini-batch tensors from the list of tuples (src_seq, trg_seq).
    We should build a custom collate_fn rather than using default collate_fn,
    because merging sequences (including padding) is not supported in default.
    Seqeuences are padded to the maximum length of mini-batch sequences (dynamic padding).
    Args:
        data: list of tuple (src_seq, trg_seq).
            - src_seq: torch tensor of shape (?); variable length.
            - trg_seq: torch tensor of shape (?); variable length.
    Returns:
        src_seqs: torch tensor of shape (batch_size, padded_length).
        src_lengths: list of length (batch_size); valid length for each padded source sequence.
        trg_seqs: torch tensor of shape (batch_size, padded_length).
        trg_lengths: list of length (batch_size); valid length for each padded target sequence.
