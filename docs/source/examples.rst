Examples
========

AIToolbox provides several example training scripts to further support better understanding of the package
functionality in addition to this documentation. All the examples are stored on github in the `/examples folder
<https://github.com/mv1388/aitoolbox/tree/master/examples>`_.

Especially interesting examples worth looking at are:

* `Model training with full experiment tracking <https://github.com/mv1388/aitoolbox/blob/master/examples/TrainLoop_use/trainloop_fully_tracked_experiment.py>`_
* `Simple TTModel definition example & training <https://github.com/mv1388/aitoolbox/blob/master/examples/TrainLoop_use/model_definition_examples/trainloop_ttmodel.py#L18>`_
* `DataParallel and DistributedDataParallel TrainLoop training examples <https://github.com/mv1388/aitoolbox/tree/master/examples/dp_ddp_training>`_
* `Apex AMP (mixed precision) TrainLoop training examples <https://github.com/mv1388/aitoolbox/tree/master/examples/apex_amp_training>`_
